# Airline Software Design

In this university project, where I was the leader, we had to design an airline ticket booking software.
The project is available at [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/EpokaDevs/SMD-project.git).

## 1. Stakeholder and Requirement Specification
- Identifies all stakeholders involved in the project.
- Details the functional and non-functional requirements.

## 2. Use Cases Specification
- Describes the various use cases.
- Defines the actors and their interactions with the system.

## 3. Activity, Sequence, and Collaboration Diagrams for the Use Cases
- Provides activity diagrams for workflow visualization.
- Includes sequence diagrams to show the order of interactions.
- Contains collaboration diagrams to illustrate object relationships.

## 4. BPMN, ERD, DFD, Use Case, Class, and Interaction Overview Diagrams
- Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) diagrams for business process representation.
- Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERD) for data modeling.
- Data Flow Diagrams (DFD) to represent data processing.
- Use case diagram for system functionalities.
- Class diagram for object-oriented design.
- Interaction overview diagrams for a holistic view of interactions.

## 5. Design Patterns Implemented in the Class Diagram for Better Software Modeling
- Highlights the use of design patterns to enhance software design and maintainability.
